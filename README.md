# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Project

This project uses data mining to predict the risk of heart attacks, focusing on how different health factors matter for different age groups. We looked at a dataset of 300 patients with 14 health features.

We used three different computer models (Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Random Forests) to predict who might have a heart attack. We also split the patients into two groups: those under 55 and those 55 and older, to see if different things predict risk in these groups.

**What we found:**

* For everyone, the **type of chest pain** and the **number of blocked heart vessels** were the most important signs.
* In younger people (under 55), things like **sex** and a blood disorder called **thalassemia** were important for one of our models.
* In older people (55 and older), **EKG results** and how the heart reacts to exercise became more important for one of the models.
* Overall, Logistic Regression was the most accurate model for predicting heart attacks in general.

**Why this matters:**

Understanding which factors are important for different age groups can help doctors better predict and prevent heart attacks in their patients.

**What's next:**

In the future, we could try using more complex computer models, adding more health information to our analysis, and testing our findings on larger and more diverse groups of people.
